# Linux MM Notes

Following on from my [linux VM notes][0] and [kernel contributions][1] of the
past I have decided to get involved in kernel development again with a focus on
the mm subsystem, a real interest of mine.

These notes will be for now a rather ad-hoc collection of things I've learnt
about the mm subsystem.
